# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for taking interest to contribute to this repositroy of mine. But I would like to keep the following guidelines before you start contributing and adding your ideas to this project.

## Few things to keep in mind!

1. When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issues with the owner of the repository before making a change. 
2. Before you add an issue, check to see if an issue exists already for the change you want to make and if it does then you can ask the maintainer to assign that issue to you.
3. While adding an issue make sure to add the following details - a detailed description of the issue, a screenshot of the issue, your ideas on how to deal with the issue.
4. If you follow all the above rules then you are good to go. Now you can fork the repository and get going. ðŸš€  

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. When you're done making changes, create a pull request.
4. While making a PR make sure to add the screenshot of the website before your changes and after your changes.
5. Once you submit your PR, the project maintainer will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review. After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation. 
6. And if you have any merge conflicts, then first resolve those.

#### Your PR is merged! ðŸ¥³

Congratulations! You've already made your successful contribution.âœ¨
